# Vicegerent

Vicegerent is a small Go application which helps you to run predefined set of commands in the server invoked by an HTTP call.

The original intent behind the project was to trigger the update commands for Docker containers from a CI/CD script without giving SSH access to the server.

The project is still under active development and has not reached the stable milestone yet.
